Core Issue
The lack of manufacturer warranty records and shipment date tracking results in dependence on distributors for return and exchange disputes. The product warranty period should be calculated based on the serial number's corresponding factory shipment date.

Meeting Notes (Updated: 2023/02/06)
Problem:
Tracking the warranty start date for products sold to customers is difficult. The ERP system only records supplier purchase transactions but lacks warehouse in/out records. This means that when backtracking via serial number, only supplier shipment data is available, raising concerns about actual warehouse entry.

Warehouse System Tracking:
A systemized warehouse in/out/transfer record that allows tracking via serial number:

Customer Information – Who received the product?
EAN/UAC Code
P/N (Product Number)
S/N (Serial Number)
Timestamp – When the transaction occurred.
Accessible to Sales Team – Online query system.
Taiwan Warehouse Only – Budget constraint (under 100,000 TWD).
